Assignment 6: RPC Programming

The (Revised) Cookie Jar Problem

Three Processes:
    1. Sister Tina (client)
    2. Sister Judy (client)
    3. Mother       (server)

Tina and Judy both request cookies from their mother at random times. The mother will give Tina a cookie whenever she want, Judy will only get a cookie after Tina has already recieved two cookies. The mother has a cookie jar with 20 cookies in it. When the cookies run out if either sister requests cookies the mother will tell them "no cookies for you" and they will stop requesting cookies.
